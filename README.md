# Nicholas King Pinball Game
 
1. I added an Intro screen with instructions on how to play the game, an explanation of the slider,
   and an explanation of the death counter.
   
2. I added an Outro screen.

3. I added an inputfield that would show the player's name while they are in game.

4. I added a death counter that shows how many times the ball is destroyed on the game screen.

5. I added a high score in the outro screen.

6. There is a last game played score on the outro screen.

7. There is a slider on the game screen that increase the gravity scale of the ball's rigidbody. This
   is meant to increase the speed of the game.
